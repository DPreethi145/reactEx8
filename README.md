    in react 2 types of components are present functional and class.
    in functional componemt the whole component itself responsible for mounting phase 
    but in class render only responsible for mounting
    Differentiate between states and props.
    states and props are used for data flow
    states are smart components because state get updated dynamically
    but props are dumb they are only static
    in state data pass in that component only, but props data flow through parentsx

    we use the hook useState() to modify the component.
